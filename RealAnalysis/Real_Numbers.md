### Chapter 1: Real Numbers

This chapter lays the foundational properties of the real numbers, crucial for understanding analysis.

*   **The Real Number System (ℝ)**: The book assumes the existence of the set of real numbers, which possesses three key properties: it is an **ordered set**, it is **complete** with respect to this order, and it is a **field** compatible with this order.
*   **Ordered Sets**: Defines concepts like being greater than or less than.
*   **Bounded Sets**:
    *   A set *E* is **bounded above** if there's an upper bound *b* such that *x* ≤ *b* for all *x* ∈ *E*.
    *   A set *E* is **bounded below** if there's a lower bound *b* such that *x* ≥ *b* for all *x* ∈ *E*.
    *   The **supremum (sup)** of *E* is its least upper bound.
    *   The **infimum (inf)** of *E* is its greatest lower bound.
    *   For convenience, **extended real numbers** (ℝ\* = ℝ ∪ {-∞, ∞}) are introduced to allow for suprema and infima of empty or unbounded sets.
    *   **Maximum (max)** and **minimum (min)** are used when the supremum or infimum is an element of the set itself.
*   **Fundamental Properties of Real Numbers**:
    *   **Archimedean Property**: For any positive real numbers *x* and *y*, there exists a natural number *n* such that *nx* > *y*. This means there's no "infinitely large" real number relative to others.
    *   **Density of Rational Numbers (ℚ in ℝ)**: Between any two distinct real numbers, there exists a rational number. This highlights how "close" rational numbers are to real numbers.
    *   **Uncountability of Real Numbers**: In contrast to the rational numbers (which are countable), the set of real numbers (ℝ) is **uncountable**. This means there are "more" real numbers than rational numbers.
*   **Intervals**: Defined as sets in ℝ that contain at least two points and all points between any two of their elements. From a cardinality perspective, all intervals have the same "size".
*   **Absolute Value**: Defined as |*x*|. A key property is the **triangle inequality**: |*x* + *y*| ≤ |*x*| + |*y*|, and its variations like the reverse triangle inequality.
*   **Bounded Functions**: A function *f* : *D* → ℝ is bounded if its range, *f*(D), is a bounded subset of ℝ.
